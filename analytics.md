## Key Features

### 1. Geolocation Map Mode  
- **Visualize Viewer Locations**  
  On the map, each marker represents a city or region where a link was opened. You can instantly see geographic patterns—e.g., clusters in Los Angeles, Phoenix, or San Jose (as shown above).  
- **Click to Get Details**  
  Clicking any marker brings up a detailed view, showing:
  - **Total Views** from that location  
  - **Time Spent** by viewers (e.g., average seconds or minutes)  
  - **Scroll Depth** (how far down the CV page users went)  
  - **Attachment Downloads** (if any assets were downloaded)  

### 2. List View Mode  
- **Switch to List Format**  
  Instead of the map, toggle to **List** mode (button in the top-right). Here, each row represents a single visit, displaying:
  - **Location** (city/region)  
  - **Timestamp** (date and time of view)  
  - **Duration** (how long the viewer stayed on the page)  
  - **Device Type** (desktop, mobile, or tablet)  
  - **Referrer** (LinkedIn, email share, direct URL, etc.)  

### 3. “New View” Badge  
- **Real-Time Notifications**  
  Whenever a new visitor opens your CV link, a green **New View** badge appears next to **Analytics** in the sidebar. This highlights fresh activity so you know immediately when someone engages.  
- **Click to Refresh Data**  
  The refresh icon in the header updates the map or list to show the latest visits—no page reload needed.

## How to Interpret Analytics Data

1. **Identify High-Interest Locations**  
   - Look for clusters of markers on the map. If multiple views originate from a single city, consider customizing your outreach or adding localized references.  
2. **Evaluate Engagement Duration**  
   - Click a marker or check the list view to see how long visitors linger. Longer durations usually indicate deeper engagement—perhaps they downloaded your attached portfolio or read through all sections.  
3. **Track Attachment Downloads**  
   - In the detailed popup (after clicking a location), note if any supporting documents were downloaded. This tells you which assets (e.g., cover letter, portfolio PDF, video) resonated most.  
4. **Monitor Referral Sources**  
   - The list view shows where traffic came from: direct link, LinkedIn, job board, or email. Use this insight to double down on channels that drive the most qualified views.  
5. **Use “New View” Indicators**  
   - Whenever you see a **New View** badge, click **Analytics** to dive into fresh data. This real-time feedback allows you to follow up promptly—especially useful if you just applied to a job and want to send a quick thank-you or personalized note.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Customize CV Versions**  
  Generate multiple CV links (e.g., `cvinci.me/yourname-design` vs `cvinci.me/yourname-marketing`) and compare analytics across them. See which version generates more engagement in specific regions or industries.  
- **Refine Your Content**  
  If the heatmap shows viewers skimming certain sections, try rewriting headlines or adding bullet points. Over time, use analytics to optimize for the most popular segments.  
- **Leverage Attachment Data**  
  If you notice a spike in “Design Portfolio” downloads but few “Cover Letter” downloads, consider revising the cover letter to be more compelling or swapping it out for a different asset.  
- **Monitor Referral Trends**  
  If LinkedIn sends 70% of your traffic, update your LinkedIn bio to highlight your CV link. If email campaigns generate the most views, double-check that your email signature includes the correct URL (`cvinci.me/yourname`).  
- **Engage Immediately**  
  Real-time “New View” alerts let you know exactly when someone is looking at your CV. If it’s a hiring manager or recruiter, consider sending a quick follow-up message while their interest is fresh.
