## Mission

## Key Features  

### Custom Shareable Links  
- Each CV publishes under a human-friendly URL (e.g., `https://cvinci.me/yourname`). No more “resume.pdf” attachments—just a simple link.  
- Create and manage multiple versions of your CV for different audiences (e.g., `https://cvinci.me/yourname-design`, `https://cvinci.me/yourname-marketing`), each with its own customized attachments and content.  
- Rename, deactivate, or duplicate links in one click from your dashboard. Each version remains live independently, so you always know which CV you’re sharing.

### Asset Library & CV Packaging  
- Upload up to **three supporting documents per CV**—portfolio PDFs, cover letters, project samples, published articles, or videos.  
- Bundle these assets into one “Download All” package so recipients can retrieve your résumé and attachments with a single click.  
- Reuse any uploaded asset across multiple CV versions without re-uploading. Instantly attach a different cover letter, portfolio PDF, or work sample to each CV link.

### Real-Time Analytics Dashboard  
- **View Count & Timing**: See exactly how many times each CV link was opened and at what time.  
- **Geolocation**: Track the approximate location (city/region) of every visitor based on IP address.  
- **Section Heatmaps & Scroll Depth**: Discover which parts of your one-page CV hold attention the longest and where viewers drop off.  
- **Attachment Downloads**: Monitor how many times each of your attached assets has been downloaded.  
- **Referral Source**: Know whether traffic comes from LinkedIn, direct email shares, job boards, or other channels.  
- **Instant Notifications**: Get optional email or Slack alerts whenever a specific viewer visits your CV link, so you can follow up in real time.


### Privacy & Access Controls  
- Choose to make a CV link **public**, **unlisted**, or **password-protected** so only those with the PIN can view it.  
- GDPR- and CCPA-compliant data handling: your personal data is never sold, and you can request deletion at any time.

## Addon Features
### Branded, One-Page CV Templates  
- Choose from multiple themes—**Classic**, **Academic**, or **Modern**—each echoing Leonardo da Vinci’s perfect proportions and balance.  
- Fully responsive design ensures your CV looks impeccable on desktop, tablet, and mobile without any extra effort.  
- Customizable color schemes, typography, and section ordering let you create a CV that feels uniquely “you.”

### AI-Powered Content Assistance  
- Upload your existing résumé (PDF, Word, or plain text) and let our AI recommend concise rewording, optimized keywords, and formatting tweaks.  
- Quickly generate new résumé drafts from scratch: submit a list of bullet points or a job description, and CVinci’s AI will draft a polished, impactful narrative for you.  
- Built-in keyword suggestions help ensure your CV passes Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and resonates with human recruiters.
